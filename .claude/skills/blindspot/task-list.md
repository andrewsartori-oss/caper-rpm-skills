# Get-to-Green: Tasks

## Skill's Purpose
This file contains the tasks and risks associated with a caper deployment, including what tasks are needed for a Caper RPM to complete in order for their project status to "get to green".
- Green Status: Project is on track to deploy on-schedule
- Yellow Status: Project has risks that may delay scheduled deployment
- Red Status: Project has serious risks that will delay scheduled deployment

## ***CRITICAL*** ##
- This skill must focus on getting the project to green for the next caper deployment at the next scheduled store

## Important: SKILL output
- The get-to-green output must be an .md file that must follow this naming convention: G2G-[retailer]-[MM]-[DD]-[YYYY]-[Time].md
    - The file name includes the time when it was created, thus there can be multiple files created on the same day without having to delete a previous one.
    - Time should be created as 24 hour clock with timezone indicated (ex: 8:00pmEST = 2000EST)
- The file directory where these files are saved must follow this naming convention: get-to-green [retailer-name].
    - If the file directory already exists, do not create another one, just save the file to that directory.
