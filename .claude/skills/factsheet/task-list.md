# Factsheet: Tasks

## Skill's Purpose
This file contains the most important facts related to a Caper Cart deployment project. These facts will be retained in one centralized document.

## Important: SKILL output
- The factsheet output must be an .md file that must follow this naming convention: factsheet-[retailer]-[MM]-[DD]-[YYYY]-[Time].md
    - The file name includes the time when it was created, thus there can be multiple files created on the same day without having to delete a previous one.
    - Time should be created as 24 hour clock with timezone indicated (ex: 8:00pmEST = 2000EST)
- The file directory where these files are saved must follow this naming convention: factsheet [retailer-name].
    - If the file directory already exists, do not create another one, just save the file to that directory.
- The output file must not exceed 10,000 words
