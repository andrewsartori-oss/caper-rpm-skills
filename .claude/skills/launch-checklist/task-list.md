# Launch-Checklist: Tasks

## Skill's Purpose
This file contains the 16 consolidated launch checklist items that MUST be validated and completed before a store can launch.
- Each item must be validated with evidence (Jira ticket, doc, Slack message, test result)
- Each item requires a status assessment: ✅ Complete / ⚠️ In Progress / ❌ Not Started / 🔍 Unknown
- Focus on the specific store (by Caper ID) or all stores for the specified retailer

## **CRITICAL** ##
- This skill validates ALL 16 required launch checklist items
- Each item must have evidence of completion or clear blockers identified
- The skill generates a GO/NO-GO/CONDITIONAL GO recommendation based on completion status
- The store ID must be the internal Caper ID (ex: prod-hgg-1, prod-clarks-1, etc.)
- If store ID is "all" or empty, validate across all stores for that retailer

## Important: SKILL output
- The launch-checklist output must be an .md file that must follow this naming convention: launch-checklist-[retailer]-[store-id]-[MM]-[DD]-[YYYY]-[Time].md
    - The file name includes the store ID and the time when it was created, thus there can be multiple files created on the same day without having to delete a previous one.
    - Time should be created as 24 hour clock with timezone indicated (ex: 8:00pmEST = 2000EST)
- The file directory where these files are saved must follow this naming convention: launch-checklist [retailer-name].
    - If the file directory already exists, do not create another one, just save the file to that directory.
