# Green-Todo: Tasks

## Skill's Purpose
This file contains only the tasks an RPM needs to complete in order to move their project to Green Status
- Green Status: Project is on track to deploy on-schedule
- Yellow Status: Project has risks that may delay scheduled deployment
- Red Status: Project has serious risks that will delay scheduled deployment

## **CRITICAL** ##
- This skill is intended to be a short, specific, action-focused list of items to complete.
- This skill cannot contain any information besides Tasks 1 and 2 

## Important: SKILL output
- The green-todo output must be an .md file that must follow this naming convention: green-todo-[retailer]-[MM]-[DD]-[YYYY]-[Time].md 
    - The file name includes the time when it was created, thus there can be multiple files created on the same day without having to delete a previous one.
    - Time should be created as 24 hour clock with timezone indicated (ex: 8:00pmEST = 2000EST)
- The file directory where these files are saved must follow this naming convention: green-todo [retailer-name]. 
    - If the file directory already exists, do not create another one, just save the file to that directory.
