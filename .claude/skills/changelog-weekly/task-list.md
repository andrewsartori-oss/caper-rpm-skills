# Changelog-Weekly: Tasks

## Skill's Purpose
This file contains the the tasks to be completed by the changelog-weekly SKILL. Those tasks include determining what changed in the project from the past week, focused on only the following areas:
- New/Updated Risks
- New/Updated Assumptions
- New/Updated Issues
- New/Updated Decisions
- New/Updated Dependencies
- New/Update Project Deployment Dates
- New/Updated Project Scope

## **CRITICAL** ##
- This skill must present a brief overview of each of the changes. 
- If there are no changes for a task listed beneath Task 2. Project Changes, then simply state "No changes this week."

## Important: SKILL output
- The changelog-weekly output must be an .md file that must follow this naming convention: changelog-[retailer]-[MM]-[DD]-[YYYY]-[Time].md
    - The file name includes the time when it was created, thus there can be multiple files created on the same day without having to delete a previous one.
    - Time should be created as 24 hour clock with timezone indicated (ex: 8:00pmEST = 2000EST)
- The file directory where these files are saved must follow this naming convention: changelog [retailer-name].
    - If the file directory already exists, do not create another one, just save the file to that directory.
- The output file must not exceed 5,000 words
